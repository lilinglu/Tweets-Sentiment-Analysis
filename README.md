# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
## The general steps I take to complete this project are:

* 1 Gather tweets about movie pet sematary using Twitter API stream
* 2 Depending on a key word search “Pet Sematary”
* 3 Format my tweets so that no capitalization, punctuation, url or non ascii characters are present, as well as splitting the     tweet into an array holding each word in a separate holder
* 4 Built a model using data sets with labeled sentiments
* 5 Compare the acurracy with TextBlob
* 6 Calculate the sentiment structure of the tweets collected
